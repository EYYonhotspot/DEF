    <h1>Designing Truth: Advocating for Smarter Digital Environments</h1>
    <p>Clarity, Structure, Experience, and Truth — for a better digital future.</p>
  </header>

  <section class="section2">
    <h2>Systems Design</h2>
    <p>Systems are a set of interconnected elements working together to achieve a goal. Key elements include feedback loops, boundaries, and resource flow. Systems Design helps users understand how digital environments function and interact.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section5">
    <h2>Advocating for Systems Design</h2>
    <p>I advocate for System Design because it is foundational to how digital environments are structured. It enables everyday users to understand and navigate digital platforms more effectively by shaping how systems function, communicate, and interact.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section3">
    <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
    <p>Information Architecture (IA) ensures users can navigate and find content through clear organization, labeling, navigation, and search systems. It defines the structure and relationships between digital content, making sites easier to use.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section5">
    <h2>Advocating for Information Architecture</h2>
    <p>Information Architecture supports the layout and flow of information within digital environments. I advocate for it because it enhances usability by shaping how users locate, access, and understand data, which is crucial for an efficient user journey.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section4">
    <h2>User Experience</h2>
    <p>UX focuses on the usability, accessibility, desirability, and overall satisfaction users have when interacting with a digital product. Elements like color theory, visual hierarchy, and intuitive design play key roles in enhancing digital engagement.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section5">
    <h2>Advocating for User Experience</h2>
    <p>User Experience shapes how individuals feel when using a digital environment. I advocate for UX because it prioritizes accessibility, visual design, and emotional engagement—factors that are essential to creating intuitive and satisfying experiences for all users.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section1">
    <h2>Combating Misinformation</h2>
    <p>Digital environments must promote truth. Strategies include system-level algorithm transparency, promoting media literacy, fact-checking, and avoiding echo chambers to prevent the spread of misinformation online.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section5">
    <h2>Advocating Against Misinformation</h2>
    <p>I advocate for addressing misinformation in digital environments because unchecked misinformation distorts reality and erodes public trust. By promoting fact-checking, algorithmic transparency, and critical media skills, we can build more trustworthy digital spaces.</p>
